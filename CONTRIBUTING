# Contributing to Kenpali JS

Quality improvements are welcome!

## I fixed a bug

- Make sure you have a test case covering the fix, one that failed before the fix but now passes. If the bug reveals a gap in the [specification](https://github.com/def-gthill/kenpali), add the test as an additional specification case rather than a new test in this repo.
- Make sure all the existing tests pass.
- Make sure you've run Prettier on your changes.
- Open a pull request explaining the bug and how you fixed it.

## I've made a performance improvement

- Confirm that performance has actually improved using `node src/benchmark.js`. If the improvement is only noticeable in a specific situation that the existing benchmarks don't cover, add a new one!
- Make sure that all the tests pass.
- Make sure you've run Prettier on your changes.
- Open a pull request explaining the improved approach and presenting benchmark results.

## I want to add a feature

This repo implements a [specification](https://github.com/def-gthill/kenpali). To add a feature, you must first add it to the specification. See the [contributing guide](https://github.com/def-gthill/kenpali/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING) in the specification repository.
